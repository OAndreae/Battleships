# Feedback areas

## Testing
* How can `Run()` be tested?
* How can `PlaceShipsOnGrid()` be tested (given that the ships are placed at random)?

## Design

## BattleshipsGame
* Injecting the I/O functions are parameters
* Move input validation loop to the `TakeTurn()` function?

## Program
* Constant/read-only variables fields

## Other
* XML vs double-slash comments for private fields (exposes information in assemblies?)
