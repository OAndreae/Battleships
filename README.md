# Battleships
A console-based game of MB's Battleships.

## Guidelines
We have a 2-stage process for this role, a take-home code test submission followed by an interview. The perfect code test solution should be simple but high-quality code and we have typically found the best test submissions have been received from those who considered the following topics before completing their challenge:
 
### Code Quality & Design:
We value readable and simply designed code. We hate over-engineering. Some topics to research:
Kent Beck's four rules of simple design
SOLID, CUPID
Code Smells
 
### Automated Testing:
All developers need to ensure that their code works. A great way to get confidence in your code is to use techniques such as Test Driven Development (TDD). TDD is a topic that's well worth trying and as a first step you should consider trying a "Code Kata" such as "Bowling game". You may also want to research Behaviour Driven Development (BDD).
 
Once you've had a chance to research the above, you should then attempt the code challenge. It is a straightforward test, but we do want to see good practices in action rather than just a single block of code. You may not apply every single area covered from the topics above in the code test, but we may ask about these topics in the second stage of the process, an interview.
 
## The Challenge
 
The challenge is to program a simplified version of the game Battleships. Create an application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.
 
The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place several ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:
 
1x Battleship (5 squares)
 
2x Destroyers (4 squares)
 
The player enters or selects coordinates of the form “A5”, where “A” is the column and “5” is the row, to specify a square to the target. Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.
 
You can write a console application or UI to complete the task. Please provide your solution in Java, C# or Typescript.
 
Try to code the challenge as you would approach any typical work task; we are not looking for you to show knowledge of frameworks or unusual programming language features. Most importantly, keep it simple. 
 
Please include a link to the source and instructions on how to build and run it and send your completed challenge back to me on this email thread. There are no set timescales here, we appreciate you taking the time out to complete the activity however, if we have not heard back from you after 1 month, we will be in touch to check whether you would like to continue with your application.
