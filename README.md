# Battleships
A console-based game of MB's Battleships.

## Guidelines
The final code should be simple and readable: not over-engineered. Research the following practices and *then* code the Battleships application, implementing the practices.

**Code quality and design topics:**
* Kent Beck's Four Rules of Simple Design
* SOLID and CUPID
* YAGNI
* Code Smells

**Automated testing:**
* Test-driven development (TDD)
* Behaviour-driven development (BDD)

## The Challenge
Program a simplified version of the game Battleships. Create an application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.
 
The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place several ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:
* 1x Battleship (5 squares)
* 2x Destroyers (4 squares)
 
The player enters or selects coordinates of the form “A5”, where “A” is the column and “5” is the row, to specify a square to the target. Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.
 
You can write a console application or UI to complete the task. Please provide your solution in Java, C# or Typescript.
 
Try to code the challenge as you would approach any typical work task; we are not looking for you to show knowledge of frameworks or unusual programming language features. Most importantly, keep it simple. 
 
Please include a link to the source and instructions on how to build and run it and send your completed challenge back to me on this email thread. There are no set timescales here, we appreciate you taking the time out to complete the activity however, if we have not heard back from you after 1 month, we will be in touch to check whether you would like to continue with your application.
